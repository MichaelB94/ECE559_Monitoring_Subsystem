ECE559 Class Description (taken from ece.duke.edu/grad/students/courses)

ECE 559(251). Advanced Digital System Design. This course covers the fundamentals of advanced digital system design, and the use of a hardware description language, VHDL, for their synthesis and simulation. Examples of systems considered include the arithmetic/logic unit, memory, and microcontrollers. The course includes an appropriate capstone design project that incorporates engineering standards and realistic constraints in the outcome of the design process. Additionally, the designer must consider most of the following: Cost, environmental impact, manufacturability, health and safety, ethics, social and political impact. Each design project is executed by a team of 4 or 5 students who are responsible for generating a final written project report and making an appropriate presentation of their results to the class. Prerequisite: Electrical and Computer Engineering 350L and co-requisite Electrical and Computer Engineering 331L or graduate student standing. Instructor: Derby. One course.
